# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Essentially, a burger logger application with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a custom made ORM. Made using a MVC design pattern; Node and MySQL to query and route data within the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger at the top of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the bottom of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
